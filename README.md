# webpack-react

This repository is include all the packages and plugins required to convert a react project to browser readable javascript. It is somewhat like `create-react-app` behaves and bundles the files to readable javascript but this is more custom way and we get to know the different packages required, so that it is more our way then their way.

## Points

* This is not the only way but a overview to get to know more.
* We can add packages and remove according to our project requirements.
* The bundle files are created in dist folder ( editable ).
* The `publicPath` in webpack is set localhost.
* If images are added, they are loacted in seperate folder(images folder).

## Suggestions
* Any type of suggestion will be greatly appreciated.
